# OKRs Management Guide

## Purpose

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) define and track our quarterly priorities and measurable outcomes.

## Structure

- **Company OKRs:** 1 primary objective with 3 key results
- **Departmental OKRs:** Supporting objectives for each team
- **Weekly Updates:** Progress tracking and adjustment

## Quarterly Cycle

1. **Week 1:** OKR setting and alignment
2. **Weeks 2-12:** Execution with weekly check-ins
3. **Week 13:** Review and scoring
4. **Week 14:** Next quarter planning

## Scoring Guidelines

- **0.7-1.0:** Green (exceeded expectations)
- **0.4-0.6:** Yellow (good progress)
- **0.0-0.3:** Red (significant gaps)
